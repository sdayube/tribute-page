# tribute-page

Built as a project for freeCodeCamp, I wanted to make a tribute to a brazilian person who I really admire.
Since i come from a Law background and from the city of Salvador, I felt compelled to make the tribute page
about Lu√≠s Gama, one of the the most prominent abolitionists of 19th century Brazil.
